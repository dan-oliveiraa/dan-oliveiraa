## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Software Engineer with **4+ years of experience** designing and delivering **mission-critical mobile applications**, especially in **fintech, payments, and offline-first environments**.

I currently work on **payment and validation systems used daily by millions of users in over 400 cities**, where performance, security, and fault-tolerance directly impact real-world operations.

I’m especially interested in:
- Clean & scalable architectures
- Payments and financial flows
- Offline-first systems
- Performance optimization
- Engineering clarity and long-term maintainability

## 🚀 Impact Highlights

- ⚡ **Performance**  
  Optimized NFC / Mifare validation routines, reducing latency by **75%** (from ~12.5s to ~3.1s) in high-traffic transport systems.

- 🔐 **Security & ROI**  
  Identified and patched critical payment handshake vulnerabilities, preventing fraud and saving **R$300K+** in potential losses.

- 💳 **Digital Wallets (Offline-First)**  
  Designed and launched an **ABT Digital Wallet** with **Pix, Apple Pay, and Google Pay**, now live in **10+ major Brazilian cities**.

- 🤖 **Execution Velocity (AI-Assisted)**  
  Integrated AI-driven workflows and knowledge-retrieval pipelines, delivering features **~3× faster** without compromising quality.

- 🧱 **Engineering Efficiency**  
  Led large-scale refactors using Clean Architecture and SOLID principles, cutting feature delivery and bug-fix time by ~50%.
